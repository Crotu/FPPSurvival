Hi
Welcome to our first attempt at a first person game in Unreal Engine. We are a group of Computer Science students located in Boston, MA at Wentworth Institute of Technology. Periodically through the development period we will be updating this readme with information on the game's current progress and the direction we see the game going in. To see more of our work check out our [last game](https://github.com/uptonm/RPG).
